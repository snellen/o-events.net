Working with YAML in this Dreamweaver version is relatively unproblematic.  The only necessary adjustment is to switch out the base.css from the /core/ folder with a special one just for designing in DW.  You must activate "Design Notes" in your project settings in order to work with alternate stylesheets.

First, in the "CSS styles" window in the "Properties" field, call up the context menu with a right mouse click and choose "Design Time...".  In the dialog box select the base.css stylesheet in the section "Hide at Design Time".

Second, repeat this sequence but in the section "Only display at Design Time", choose the file 'base_dw7.css' from the /tools/dreamweaver_7/ folder in the download package.

Now close any HTML document and open it again.  The changed settings should now be in effect and your YAML-based layout is error-free in Design Mode, allowing you to edit it there without any problems.

Enjoy YAML!
