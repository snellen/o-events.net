Data Model Description
Project: o-events.net

NOTE: The models are spelled with CapitalLetters here and in the diagram, but with_underscores in the actual application.
      Also, i18n of event-specific strings is not implemented in the DB structure (yet).

==
AdditionalFee: Fees for additional services which do not depend on the Competitors' age, Category, or other parameters. Example: Set of training maps provided by the organizer.
  name:string          The name of the fee, as determined by the event organizer.
  description:string   A short description of the fee. 
  amount:decimal       The fee (in the event's main currency).
  event:ref            The event that the fee belongs to.
  age_range:ref        The age range that the fee applies to. Zero for team events.
==
AgeRange: Range used to define StartFees depending on age. Note that this can only be used for single events, since the age of a Team is not defined otherwise.
  lower:integer        The lower end of the age range.
  upper:integer        The upper end of the age range. 99 is treated as infinity.
  type:string          Either 'start_fee' or 'additional_fee'. Used to list an event's age ranges for start and additional fees separately.
  event:ref            The event that the range is used in.
==
Category: Group of Teams which compete against each other. Each Competition generates an overall result list (TotalResult) for each Category.

The Category usually determines the length of the courses to be run throughout an Event.
  name:string        The name of the category, as displayed to the user.
  slug:string        A unique category name consisting only of latin letters and digits. (Use in URLs and maybe in export files.)
