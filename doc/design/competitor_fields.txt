=> Form:

- To simplify the user interface, use just one form
- Top row: Search field for username (may be filled)
- Name fields: Search fields for name (may be filled)
- Nationality field: Selector for nationality (may be selected) or nothing
- Club field: Selector for club (may be selected) or nothing
- If the user has not done a search, end the form here and show suggested people
- If search is disabled or a search has been done, show the rest of the fields
  (fill them when editing an existing competitor)
- The search by username is in the user/search partial, the rest is in competitors/form,
  and the entire form is built in competitors/add.
- Form action is search_user in search form mode, and team_members in competitor edit mode.
